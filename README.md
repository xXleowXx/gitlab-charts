# Cloud Native GitLab Helm Chart

The `gitlab` chart is the best way to operate GitLab on Kubernetes. This chart contains all the required components to get started, and can scale to large deployments.

Some of the key benefits of this chart and [corresponding containers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG) are:
* Improved scalability and reliability
* No requirement for root privileges
* Utilization of object storage instead of NFS for storage

The default deployment includes:

- Core GitLab components: Unicorn, Shell, Workhorse, Registry, Sidekiq, and Gitaly
- Optional dependencies: Postgres, Redis, Minio
- An auto-scaling, unprivileged [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) using the Kubernetes executor
- Automatically provisioned SSL via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
