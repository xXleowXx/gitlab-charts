# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 4.0

Along with the `13.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `4.0`.

## Summary of major changes

- WIP

## Problematic Helm 2.15

Helm v2.15.x [has a severe bug](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6767), and absolutely should not be used.

If you are to use Helm 2, use `2.14.3` or `>= 2.16.1`.

## Upgrade path from 3.x

In order to upgrade to the `4.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `3.3.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

If you don't first upgrade to the latest `3.3.x` patch, you will see the following error from `helm upgrade`

```bash
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded
```

You can then confirm you are in this situation by looking for pods in error with the text `gitlab-upgrade-check` in the name.

If you check the logs for those pods will see the version upgrade error message:

```plaintext
It seems you are upgrading the GitLab Helm Chart from X (GitLab X) to 4.0.0 (GitLab 13.0.0).
It is required to upgrade to the latest 3.3.x version first before proceeding.
Please follow the upgrade documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html
and upgrade to GitLab Helm Chart version 3.3.x before upgrading to 4.0.0.
```

## Upgrade from 3.3.x

Please follow the [upgrade steps for 4.0 release](../installation/upgrade.md).
