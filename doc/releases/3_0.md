# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 3.0

We have bumped the chart version to `3.0` in order to take in several major changes in our chart dependencies, some of which require
manual actions to complete the upgrade.

## Summary of major changes

- The bundled PostgreSQL database is [upgraded to 10.9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/1535)
- The version of Redis has [changed from 4.x to 5.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/1519)
- The Prometheus chart has been [upgraded from 9.0.x to 9.4.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/1702)
- Other minor changes also required the version bump can be found linked in our [3.0 release epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/charts/-/epics/6)

## Problematic Helm 2.15

Helm v2.15.x [has a severe bug](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6767), and absolutely should not be used.

If you are to use Helm 2, use `2.14.3` or `>= 2.16.1`.

## Upgrade path from 2.x

In order to upgrade to the `3.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `2.6.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

If you don't first upgrade to the latest `2.6.x` patch, you will see the following error from `helm upgrade`

```bash
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded
```

You can then confirm you are in this situation by looking for pods in error with the text `gitlab-upgrade-check` in the name.

If you check the logs for those pods will see the version upgrade error message:

```
It seems you are upgrading the GitLab Helm Chart from X (GitLab X) to 3.0.0 (GitLab 12.7.0).
It is required to upgrade to the last minor version in a major version series
first before jumping to the next major version.
Please follow the upgrade documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html
and upgrade to GitLab Helm Chart version 2.6.0 before upgrading to 3.0.0.
```

### NGINX Ingress

We addressed [issue #1710](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/1710),
and that change will fix _future_ upgrades, but requires a manual intervention when
upgrading from a version of the chart prior to `3.0`.

Instructions on addressing this can be found in our troubleshooting documentation,
under [Immutable Field Error, spec.clusterIP](../troubleshooting/index.md#specclusterip).

### Sidekiq Selectors

The Sidekiq chart [did not assign unique selectors to deployments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/663). This prevented deployments from being able to properly identify their Sidekiq pods and clean up as necessary. Due to the nature of selectors, upgrading will require a manual intervention.

Use the steps outlined in [the troubleshooting documentation for Immutable Field Error, spec.selector](../troubleshooting/index.md/spec.selector) to clear the deployment error.

### TODO Additional components

## Upgrade path from 1.x

You first need to upgrade to the `2.6.x` release of the charts, before upgrading to `3.0`. Please follow the
[2.0 upgrade documentation](2_0.md).  

## Known issues and limitations

Below is a list of the known issues and limitations, although it may not be exhaustive.

Helm Chart Issues/Limitations:

- No GitLab Pages support: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/37>
- Restoring backups taken from install types other than this GitLab chart require you to migrate the original instance to object storage first: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/646>
- [Smartcard authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/988)

Features that are currently out of scope:

- Relative URL as the GitLab Endpoint: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/issues/406>

## Release cadence

We will be releasing a new version of the chart with each new GitLab patch.

More information on how we are versioning the chart can be found in the [release documentation](../development/release.md).

Along with the issues and merge requests in this repo, a [changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is available to more easily follow along with updates.

## Kubernetes deployment support

GitLab is tested against:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

Other Kubernetes deployments should also work. In the event of a specific non-GKE deployment issue, please raise an issue.

We are currently using Kubernetes version 1.12.10 in our automated tests, and 1.13.11 for development.
