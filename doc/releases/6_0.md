# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 6.0

Along with the `15.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `6.0`.

## Summary of major changes

- The bundled PostgreSQL database is [upgraded to 13.3](#postgresql)

## Upgrade path from 5.x

In order to upgrade to the `6.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `5.10.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

## Major Changes

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL 13.3 is the recommended version, but PostgreSQL 12.7 is still
supported.

NOTE:
Although it is not required for this major release, you should
start planning for an upgrade to PostgreSQL 13.
