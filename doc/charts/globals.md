# Configure Charts using Globals

To reduce configuration duplication when installing our wrapper Helm chart, several configuration settings are available
to be set in the `global` section of `values.yml`. These global settings are used across several charts, all other settings
are scoped within their chart. See the [Helm documentation on globals](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/#global-values)
for more information on how the global variables work.

- [Hosts](#configure-host-settings)
- [Ingress](#configure-ingress-settings)
- [GitLab Version](#gitlab-version)
- [PostgreSQL](#configure-postgresql-settings)
- [Redis](#configure-redis-settings)
- [Registry](#configure-registry-settings)
- [Gitaly](#configure-gitaly-settings)
- [Minio](#configure-minio-settings)
- [appConfig](#configure-appconfig-settings)
- [GitLab Shell](#configure-gitlab-shell-settings)
- [Custom Certificate Authorities](#custom-certificate-authorities)
- [Application Resource](#application-resource)

## Configure Host settings

The GitLab global host settings are located under the `global.hosts` key.

```YAML
global:
  hosts:
    domain: example.com
    hostSuffix: staging
    https: false
    externalIP:
    gitlab:
      name: gitlab.example.com
      https: false
    registry:
      name: registry.example.com
      https: false
    minio:
      name: minio.example.com
      https: false
```

#### domain

The base domain. GitLab and Registry will be exposed on the subdomain of this setting. This defaults to `example.com`,
but is not used for hosts that have their `name` property configured. See the `gitlab.name`, `minio.name`, and `registry.name` sections below.

#### hostSuffix

Appended to the subdomain when assembling a hostname using the base `domain`. But this is not used for hosts that have their
own `name` set.

Defaults to being unset. If set the suffix is appended to the subdomain with a hyphen.

```yaml
global:
  hosts:
    domain: example.com
    hostSuffix: staging
```

The above config would result in using external hostnames like: `gitlab-staging.example.com` and `registry-staging.example.com`

#### https

Set to false for external urls to use `http://` instead of `https`. Defaults to true. If set to true, you will need to ensure
the nginx chart has access to the certificates.

#### externalIP

Set the external IP address that will be claimed from the provider. This will be templated into the
[nginx chart](nginx/index.md#configuring-the-service), in place of the more complex `nginx.service.loadBalancerIP`.
Defaults to `nil`.

### gitlab

The `gitlab` section of `global.hosts` includes configuration for the GitLab external hostname, and which internal service
to point the hostname to.

#### gitlab.name

The hostname for gitlab. If set, this hostname is used, regardless of the `global.hosts.domain` and `global.hosts.hostSuffix` settings.

#### gitlab.https

If `hosts.https` or `gitlab.https` are `true`, the GitLab external url to use `https://` instead of `http://`. Defaults to `false`.

#### gitlab.serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the GitLab server. The chart will template the hostname of the service (and
current `.Release.Name`) to create the proper internal serviceName. This will default to `unicorn`

#### gitlab.servicePort

The named port of the `service` where the GitLab server can be reached. This defaults to `workhorse`.

### registry

The `registry` section of `global.hosts` includes configuration for the Registry external hostname, and which internal service
to point the hostname to.

#### registry.name

The hostname for Registry. If set, this hostname is used, regardless of the `global.hosts.domain` and `global.hosts.hostSuffix` settings.

#### registry.https

If `hosts.https` or `registry.https` are `true`, the Registry external url to use `https://` instead of `http://`. Defaults to `false`.

#### registry.serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the Registry server. The chart will template the hostname of the service (and
current `.Release.Name`) to create the proper internal serviceName. This will default to `registry`

#### registry.servicePort

The named port of the `service` where the Registry server can be reached. This defaults to `registry`.

### minio

The `minio` section of `global.hosts` includes configuration for the Minio external hostname, and which internal service
to point the hostname to.

#### minio.name

The hostname for Minio. If set, this hostname is used, regardless of the `global.hosts.domain` and `global.hosts.hostSuffix` settings.

#### minio.https

If `hosts.https` or `minio.https` are `true`, the Minio external url to use `https://` instead of `http://`. Defaults to `false`.

#### minio.serviceName

The name of the `service` which is operating the Minio server. The chart will template the hostname of the service (and
current `.Release.Name`) to create the proper internal serviceName. This will default to `minio`

#### minio.servicePort

The named port of the `service` where the Minio server can be reached. This defaults to `minio`.

## Configure Ingress settings

The GitLab global host settings are located under the `global.ingress` key.

|name|type|default|
|:---|:---|:------|
|[global.ingress.enabled](#global-ingress-enabled)|boolean|true|
|[global.ingress.configureCertmanager](#global-ingress-configurecertmanger)|boolean|true|
|[global.ingress.tls.secretName](#global-ingress-tls-secretName)|string|(empty)|
|[global.ingress.annotations.*annotation-key*](#global-ingress-annotations-annotation-key)|string|(empty)|

### global.ingress.enabled

Global setting that controls whether to create ingress objects for services that support them. Defaults to `true`.

### global.ingress.configureCertmanager

Global setting that controls the automatic configuration of [cert-manager](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/cert-manager) for ingress objects.

If `true`, relies on `certmanager-issuer.email` being set.

If `false`, and `global.ingress.tls.secretName` is not set, this will activate automatic self-signed certificate generation, which creates a **wildcard** certificate for all ingress objects.

**NOTE:** If you wish to use an external `cert-manager`, you must provide the following:
- `gitlab.unicorn.ingress.tls.secretName`
- `registry.ingress.tls.secretName`
- `minio.ingress.tls.secretName`
- `global.ingress.annotations`

Defaults to `true`.

### global.ingress.tls.secretName

The name of the [Kubernetes TLS Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls) that contains a **wildcard** certificate and key for the domain used in `global.hosts.domain`.

Defaults to not being set.

### global.ingress.annotations.annotation-key

Where `annotation-key` is a string that will be used with the value as an annotation on every ingress.

ex:

`global.ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/enable-access-log"=true`

No global annotations are provided by default.

## GitLab Version

The GitLab version used in the default image tag for the charts can be changed using the `global.gitlabVersion` key.

```bash
--set global.gitlabVersion=11.0.1
```

This impacts the default image tag used in the `unicorn`, `sidekiq`, and `migration` charts. Note that the `gitaly`, `gitlab-shell` and `gitlab-runner`
image tags should be separately updated to versions compatible with the GitLab version.

## Configure PostgreSQL settings

The GitLab global PostgreSQL settings are located under the `global.psql` key.

```YAML
global:
  psql:
    host: db.example.com
    port: 5432
    password:
      secret: gitlab-postgres
      key: psql-password
```

For further details on these settings, see the documentation within the
[unicorn chart](gitlab/unicorn/index.md#postgresql)

## Configure Redis settings

The GitLab global Redis settings are located under the `global.redis` key.

```YAML
global:
  redis:
    host: redis.example.com
    port: 6379
    password:
      secret: gitlab-redis
      key: redis-password
```

For further details on these settings, see the documentation within the
[unicorn chart](gitlab/unicorn/index.md#redis)

## Configure Registry settings

The global Registry settings are located under the `global.registry` key.

```YAML
global:
  registry:
    bucket: registry
    certificate:
    httpSecret:
```

For futher details on these settings, see the documentation within the
[registry chart](registry/index.md)

## Configure Gitaly settings

The global Gitaly settings are located under the `global.gitaly` key.

```YAML
global:
  gitaly:
    internal:
      names:
        - default
        - default2
    external:
      - name: node1
        hostname: node1.example.com
        port: 8075
    authToken:
      secret: gitaly-secret
      key: token
```

### Gitaly hosts

[Gitaly][gitaly] is a service that provides high-level RPC access to Git repositories,
which handles all Git calls made by GitLab.

Administrators can chose to use Gitaly nodes in the following ways:
- internal to the chart, as part of a `StatefulSet` via [Gitaly chart](gitlab/gitaly/)
- external to the chart, as external pets
- mixed environment using both internal and external nodes

See [Repostiry Storage Paths][storage] documentation for details on managing which
nodes will be used for new projects.

**NOTE:** If `gitaly.host` is provided, `gitaly.internal` and `gitaly.external`
properties will _be ignored_. See [deprecated Gitaly settings](#deprecated-gitaly-settings).

#### Internal

The `internal` key currently consist of one key, `names`. `names` is a list of
[storage names][storage] to be managed by chart. For each name listed here, _in logical order_,
one pod will be spawned, named `${releaseName}-gitaly-${ordinal}`, where `ordinal` is
the index within the `names` list. If dynamic provisioning is enabled, the `PersistentVolumeClaim` will match.

This list defaults to `['default']`, which provides for 1 pod related to one [storage path][storage].

**NOTE:** Manual scaling of this item is required, adding or removing entries in
`gitaly.internal.names`. When scaling down, any repository
that has not been moved to another node will become unavailable. Because the
Gitaly chart is a `StatefulSet`, dynamically provisioned disks _will not_
be reclaimed. This means the data disks will persist, and the data on them can be
accessed when the set is scaled up again by re-adding a node to the `names` list.

A sample [configuration of multiple internal nodes](../../examples/gitaly/values-multiple-internal.yaml)
can be found under the examples folder.

#### External

The `external` key provides a configuration for Gitaly nodes external to the cluster.
Each item of this list has 3 keys:
- `name`: the name of the [storage][storage]
- `hostname`: the host of Gitaly services
- `port`: (optional) the port number to reach the host on. Defaults to `8075`.

**NOTE:** You must have an entry with `name: default`.

A sample [configuration of multiple external nodes](../../examples/gitaly/values-multiple-external.yaml)
can be found under the examples folder.

#### Mixed

It is possible to use both internal and external Gitaly nodes. Some caveats should
be noted:
- There must always be a node named `default`, which Internal provides by default.
- External nodes will be populated first, then Internal.

A sample [configuration of mixed internal and external nodes](../../examples/gitaly/values-multiple-mixed.yaml)
can be found under the examples folder.

### authToken

The `authToken` attribute for Gitaly has to sub keys:
- `secret` defines the name of the kubernetes `Secret` to pull from
- `key` defines the name of the key in the above secret that contains the authToken.

**NOTE:** All Gitaly nodes **must** to share the same authentication token.

### Deprecated Gitaly settings

#### host

**Deprecated**

The hostname of the Gitaly server to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `serviceName`.

If this setting is used, it will override any values of `internal` or `external`.

#### port

**Deprecated**

The port on which to connect to the Gitaly server. Defaults to `8075`.

#### serviceName

**Deprecated**

The name of the `service` which is operating the Gitaly server. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `host` value. This is convenient when using Gitaly as a part of the overall GitLab chart. This will default to `gitaly`

## Configure Minio settings

The GitLab global Minio settings are located under the `global.minio` key.

```
global:
  minio:
    enabled: true
    credentials: {}
```

For further details on these settings, see the documentation within the
[minio chart](minio/index.md)

## Configure appConfig settings

The [unicorn][], [sidekiq][], and [task-runner][] charts share multiple settings, which are configured
with the `global.appConfig` key.

```
global:
  appConfig:
    enableUsagePing: true
    defaultCanCreateGroup: true
    usernameChangingEnabled: true
    issueClosingPattern:

```

[unicorn]: gitlab/unicorn/index.md
[sidekiq]: gitlab/sidekiq/index.md
[task-runner]: gitlab/task-runner/index.md

### General application settings

The settings that can be used to tweak the general properties of the Rails
application are described below.

#### enableUsagePing

A flag to disable the [usage ping support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.html).

Defaults to `true`

#### defaultCanCreateGroup

A flag to decide if users are allowed to create groups.

Defaults to `true`.

#### usernameChangingEnabled

A flag to decide if users are allowed to change their username.

Defaults to `true`.

#### issueClosingPattern

[Pattern to close issues automatically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/issue_closing_pattern.html).
It takes a string value, and defaults to an empty value.

#### defaultTheme

[Numeric ID of the default theme for the GitLab instance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/lib/gitlab/themes.rb#L14-25). It takes a number, denoting the id of the theme, as value and has an empty
default value.

#### defaultProjectsFeatures

Flags to decide if new projects should by default be created with respective
feature.

All flags default to `true`.

```YAML
defaultProjectsFeatures:
  issues: true
  mergeRequests: true
  wiki: true
  snippets: true
  builds: true
```

#### webHookTimeout

[Waiting time in seconds before a hook is deemed failure](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#receiving-duplicate-or-multiple-web-hook-requests-triggered-by-one-event). It takes a
number, denoting the time in seconds, as value and has an empty default value.

### Gravatar/Libravatar settings

By default, the charts work with Gravatar avatar service available at
gravatar.com. However, if needed, a custom Libravatar service can also be used.
It consists of two subkeys, both of which take string values pointing to URLs
and have an empty default value.

#### plainUrl

[HTTP URL to libravatar instance (instead of using gravatar.com)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/customization/libravatar.html)

#### sslUrl

[HTTPS URL to libravatar instance (instead of using gravatar.com)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/customization/libravatar.html)

### Hooking Analytics services to the GitLab instance

Settings to configure Analytics services like Google Analytics and Piwik are
defined under the `extra` key below `appConfig`.

#### googleAnalyticsId

Tracking ID for Google Analytics. Takes a string value as input and has an empty
default value.

#### piwikUrl

Piwik URL. Takes a string value as input and has an empty default value.

#### piwikSiteId

Piwik Site ID. Takes a string value as input and has an empty default value.

### LFS / Artifacts / Uploads / Packages

Details on these settings are below. Documentation is not repeated individually,
as they are structurally identical aside default value of the `bucket` property.

```YAML
  enabled: true
  proxy_download: true
  bucket:
  connection:
    secret:
    key:
```

#### enabled

Enable the use of these features with object storage.

Defaults to `true`

#### proxy_download

Enable proxy of all downloads via GitLab, in place of direct downloads from the `bucket`.

Defaults to `true`

#### bucket

Name of the bucket to use from object storage provider.

Defaults shown above.

#### connection

The `connection` property has been transitioned to a Kubernetes Secret. The contents
of this secret should be a yaml config file.

Defaults to `{}` and will be ignored if `global.minio.enabled` is `true`.

This property has two sub-keys: `secret` and `key`.
- `secret` is the name of a Kubernetes Secret. This value is required to use external object storage.
- `key` is the name of the key in the secret which houses the YAML block. Defaults to `connection`.

Valid configuration keys can be found at
[GitLab Job Artifacts Administration][artifactscon] documentation. This matches to
[Fog](https://github.com/fog), and is different between provider modules.

Example contents to be placed in the secret:

```
provider: AWS
aws_access_key_id: BOGUS_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key: BOGUS_SECRET_KEY
region: us-east-1
```

[artifactscon]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_artifacts.html#s3-compatible-connection-settings

### Incoming email settings

These settings are explained in [command line options page](../installation/command-line-options.md#incoming-email-configuration).

### LDAP

#### ldap.servers

This setting allows for the configuration of [LDAP](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap.html) user authentication. It is presented as a map, which will be translated into the the appropriate LDAP servers configuration in `gitlab.yml`, as with an installation from source.

An example configuration snippet:
```YAML
ldap:
  servers:
    # 'main' is the GitLab 'provider ID' of this LDAP server
    main:
      label: 'LDAP'
      host: '_your_ldap_server'
      port: 636
      uid: 'sAMAccountName'
      bind_dn: 'cn=administrator,cn=Users,dc=domain,dc=net'
```

Example configuration `--set` items, when using the global chart:
```
--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.label='LDAP' \
--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.host='your_ldap_server' \
--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.port='636' \
--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.uid='sAMAccountName' \
--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.bind_dn='cn=administrator\,cn=Users\,dc=domain\,dc=net'
```

Commas are considered [special characters](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/using_helm.md#the-format-and-limitations-of---set) within Helm `--set` items. Be sure to escape commas in values such as `bind_dn`: `--set global.appConfig.ldap.servers.main.bind_dn='cn=administrator\,cn=Users\,dc=domain\,dc=net'`

### OmniAuth

GitLab can leverage OmniAuth to allow users to sign in using Twitter, GitHub, Google, and other popular services. Expanded documentation can be found in [OmniAuth documentation][omniauth] for GitLab.

```YAML
omniauth:
  enabled: false
  autoSignInWithProvider:
  syncProfileFromProvider: []
  syncProfileAttributes: ['email']
  allowSingleSignOn: ['saml']
  blockAutoCreatedUsers: true
  autoLinkLdapUser: false
  autoLinkSamlUser: false
  externalProviders: []
  providers: []
  # - secret: gitlab-google-oauth2
  #   key: provider
```

#### enabled

Enable / disable the use of OmniAuth with GitLab.

Defaults to `false`

#### autoSignInWithProvider

Single provider name to be allowed to automatically sign in. This should match the name of the provider, such as `saml` or `google_oauth2`.

Defaults to `nil`

#### syncProfileFromProvider

List of provider names that GitLab should automatically sync profile information from. Entries should match the name of the provider, such as `saml` or `google_oauth2`

Defaults to `[]`

See [Keep OmniAuth user profiles up to date][omniauth-profiles]

#### syncProfileAttributes

List of profile attributes to sync from the provider upon login. See [Keep OmniAuth user profiles up to date][omniauth-profiles] for options.

Defaults to `['email']`

#### allowSingleSignOn

Enable the automatic creation of accounts when signing in with OmniAuth.

Defaults to `false`

#### blockAutoCreatedUsers

If `true` auto created users will be blocked by default and will have to be unblocked by an administrator before they are able to sign in.

Defaults to `true`

#### autoLinkLdapUser

`autoLinkLdapUser` can be used if you have LDAP / ActiveDirectory integration enabled. When enabled, users automatically created through OmniAuth will be linked to their LDAP entry as well.

Defaults to `false`

#### autoLinkSamlUser

`autoLinkSamlUser` can be used if you have SAML integration enabled. When enabled, users automatically created through OmniAuth will be linked to their SAML entry as well.

Defaults to `false`

#### externalProviders

You can define which OmniAuth providers you want to be `external` so that all users **creating accounts, or logging in via these providers** will not be able to have access to internal projects. You will need to use the full name of the provider, like `google_oauth2` for Google.

Defaults to `[]`

See [Configure OmniAuth Providers as External](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html#configure-omniauth-providers-as-external)

#### providers

`providers` is presented as an array of maps that are used to populate `gitlab.yml` as when installed from source. The available selection of [Supported Providers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html#supported-providers) can be found in GitLab documentation.

Member items:
- `secret`: (required) The name of a Kubernetes `Secret` containing the provider block.
- `key`: (optional) The name of the key in the `Secret` containing provider block. Defaults to `provider`

The `Secret` for these entries contains YAML or JSON formatted blocks, as describe in [OmniAuth Providers][omniauth-providers]. To create this secret, follow the appropriate instructions for retrieval of these items, and create a YAML or JSON file.

Example of configuration of Google OAuth2:

```YAML
name: google_oauth2
label: Google
app_id: 'APP ID'
app_secret: 'APP SECRET'
args:
  access_type: offline
  approval_prompt: ''
```

This content can be saved `provider.yaml`, and then a secret created from it: `kubectl create secret generic -n NAMESPACE SECRET_NAME --from-file=provider=provider.yaml`

Once created, the `providers` are enabled by providing the map in configuration, as shown below.

```YAML
omniauth:
  providers:
    - secret: gitlab-google-oauth2
    - secret: gitlab-azure-oauth2
    - secret: gitlab-cas3
```

Example configuration `--set` items, when using the global chart:
```
--set global.appConfig.omniauth.providers[0].secret=gitlab-google-oauth2 \
```

Due to the complexity of using `--set` arguments, a user may wish to use a YAML snippet, passed to `helm` with `-f omniauth.yaml`.

Defaults to `[]`.

### Pseudonymizer settings

```
global:
  appConfig:
    pseudonymizer:
      configMap:
      bucket: gitlab-pseudo
      connection: {}
```

Use these settings to configure [Pseudonymizer service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pseudonymizer.html)

#### configMap

Name of the configmap having custom manifest file. Defaults to empty.

GitLab ships with a [default manifest file for Pseudonymizer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/config/pseudonymizer.yml).
Users can provide a custom one as a configmap. First, create a configmap

```bash
kubectl create configmap <name of the configmap> --from-file=pseudonymizer.yml=<path to pseudonymizer_config.yml>
```

**`Note:`** Please make sure the key specified in the above command to create
configmap is `pseudonymizer.yml`.  It is used to point the service to the
correct location and thus an incorrect key will cause Pseudonymizer to not work.

Pass the argument `--set global.appConfig.pseudonymizer.configMap=<name of the configmap>`
to `helm install` command to instruct GitLab to use this manifest instead of the
default one.

#### bucket

Name of the bucket to use from object storage provider. Defaults to
`gitlab-pseudo`.

#### connection

Details of the Kubernetes secret that contains connection information for the
object storage provider. The contents of this secret should be a yaml config file.

Defaults to `{}` and will be ignored if `global.minio.enabled` is `true`.

This property has two sub-keys: `secret` and `key`.
- `secret` is the name of a Kubernetes Secret. This value is required to use external object storage.
- `key` is the name of the key in the secret which houses the YAML block. Defaults to `connection`.

The content of the secret matches to [Fog](https://github.com/fog), and is
different between provider modules.

Example contents to be placed in the secret:

```
provider: AWS
aws_access_key_id: BOGUS_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key: BOGUS_SECRET_KEY
region: us-east-1
```

## Configure GitLab Shell

There are several items for the global configuration of [GitLab Shell](gitlab/gitlab-shell/index.md) chart.

```yaml
global:
  shell:
    port:
    authToken: {}
    hostKeys: {}
```

### Ingress port

You can control the port use by the Ingress to pass SSH traffic, as well as the port used in SSH URLs provided from GitLab via `global.shell.port`. This defaults to `22`

### Authorization token

See [authToken](gitlab/gitlab-shell#authtoken) in chart specific documentaion.

### Host Keys

See [hostKeys](gitlab/gitlab-shell#hostkeyssecret) in chart specific documentaion.

## Custom Certificate Authorities

> **NOTE**: These settings do not affect charts from outside of this repository, via requirements.yaml.

Some users may need to add custom certificate authorities, such as when using internally issued SSL certificates for TLS services. To provide this functionaliy, we provide a mechanism for injecting these custom root CAs into the application via secrets.

```
global:
  certificates:
    customCAs:
      - secret: internal-cas
      - secret: other-custom-cas
```

A user can provide any number of secrets, each containing any number of keys that hold PEM encoded CA certificates. These are configured as entries under `global.certificates.customCAs`. All keys within the secret will be mounted, so all keys across all secrets must be unique.

> **NOTE** These secrets can be named in any fashion, but they _must not_ contain key names that collide.

To create a secret:

`kubectl create secret generic custom-ca --from-file=unique_name=/path/to/cert`

To configure:

```
helm install gitlab \
  --set global.certificates.customCAs[0].secret=custom-ca
```

## Application Resource

GitLab optionally includes an [Application resource](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application), which can created to identify the GitLab application within the cluster. Requires the [Application CRD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application#installing-the-crd), version`v1beta1`, to already be deployed to the cluster.

To enable, set to `global.application.create` to `true`:

```yaml
global:
  application:
    create: true
```
